# Data
__S2__ --> 128x128 Image - 10 bands - 10m _(varies across bands?)_ - 43 dates so (43, 10, 128, 128)<br>

TODO<br>
Annotations --> panoptic: instance segmentation + semantic segmentation<br>
assigning a unique index to each object instance<br>
assigning a label to each pixel indicating the type of object or land cover<br>
Instance Index: Each object or instance within the images is assigned a unique index, allowing for individual identification and tracking.<br>
Semantic Label: In addition to instance indices, semantic labels are assigned to each pixel, providing information about the type of object or land cover represented by that pixel.<br>
